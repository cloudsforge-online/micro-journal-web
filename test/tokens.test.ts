/**
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * AN UNDEFINED CUSTOM PROPERTY DOES NOT FALL BACK. IT DELETES THE DECLARATION.
 *
 * `border: 1px solid var(--cf-does-not-exist)` is invalid at computed-value time, which means the
 * whole declaration is discarded and the element inherits or takes its initial value. The border
 * does not become a default border; it disappears. The stylesheet still parses, nothing warns, and
 * the file looks correct in review.
 *
 * The estate has shipped exactly this. `micro-mint-web/src/styles.css` names ten properties that do
 * not exist — `--cf-border`, `--cf-radius-md`, `--cf-space-1` through `--cf-space-5` and
 * `--cf-status-good`/`-warn`/`-crit` — across seventy-two declarations, every one of them inert.
 *
 * A CLASS behaves the same way and is the more common mistake, because a class name is a plausible
 * guess: `cf-card` reads exactly like something a design system would have. When it does not exist
 * the element is simply unstyled, which looks like a layout bug rather than a typo.
 *
 * So both are checked against the design system's own stylesheets, read from the sibling checkout
 * that `package.json` already links.
